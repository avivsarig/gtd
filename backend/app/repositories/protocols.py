"""Repository protocol definitions for dependency injection.

These protocols define the interface contracts for all repositories in the application.
They enable dependency injection, improve testability, and provide type safety through
structural subtyping (duck typing).

Protocols follow the SOLID principles:
- Single Responsibility: Each protocol defines interface for one domain
- Open/Closed: Open for extension via new implementations, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Any implementation can substitute for another
- Interface Segregation: Minimal, focused interfaces
- Dependency Inversion: Controllers depend on protocols, not concrete classes
