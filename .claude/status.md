# GTD Project Status

---

**Test Coverage:**

- Frontend: 535 tests passing (21 test files)
- Total: **786 tests passing**

---

## Completed Features
### Backend (API Layer Complete)
- 3-layer clean architecture (API → Controller → Repository)
- PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- 10 database migrations applied (tasks, contexts, notes, projects, inbox, full-text search, triggers, context soft-delete)
- Docker containerization with docker-compose
- 251 backend tests passing (150 unit + 101 integration)
- **Code Quality Improvements:**
  - BaseRepository pattern - DRY compliance across all repositories
  - Mixins pattern (SoftDeletableMixin, SearchableMixin) - eliminated model duplication
  - **All models now use SoftDeletableMixin** - consistent soft-delete across Task/Note/Project/InboxItem/Context
  - SearchableMixin with automatic field derivation
  - SQL injection prevention in migration helpers
  - Centralized UUID utilities module - app.core.uuid_utils with generate_uuid() function
  - BaseSelect UI component - eliminated duplication across select components
  - **Pydantic base schemas** - ResponseBase/SoftDeletableResponseBase reduce schema duplication across 4 schemas

**APIs Implemented:**
- Tasks: Full CRUD + status management + completion + bulk updates + filtering
- Projects: Full CRUD + completion + task statistics
- Notes: Full CRUD + project association
- Contexts: Full CRUD + soft-delete + name uniqueness (partial unique index allows reuse after deletion)
- Inbox: Full CRUD + conversion endpoints (task/note/project)
- Search: Full-text search across tasks/notes/projects with relevance ranking

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
- Dark mode by default
- Routing configured
- API client with full type safety
- 535 frontend tests passing (Vitest + React Testing Library, 21 test files)

**UI Components:**
- Home page with task list and notes
- UniversalCapture modal (Cmd+K inbox capture)
- Inbox processing page with keyboard shortcuts (T/N/P/D)
- Status filter tabs (All/Next/Waiting/Someday)
- Status dropdown with color coding
- Task completion checkbox with visual feedback
- Project assignment dropdown
- Notes list with expand/collapse
- Note creation and editing form
- ContextManager and ContextSelect components
- **SearchBar component** - full-text search with debouncing, type filtering, keyboard navigation
- **BaseSelect component** - reusable select with CVA variants (default/status/project/context)

### Development Tooling
- Makefile with 20+ commands
- ESLint + Prettier configured
- Type checking (mypy + TypeScript strict)
- pytest with fixtures and factories
- Coverage reporting (HTML/XML/terminal)
- Pre-commit hooks configuration ready

## Code Quality Improvements

### ✅ Done
1. **BaseRepository pattern** - Eliminated ~70% duplication across 5 repositories
2. **Model Mixins (TimestampMixin, SoftDeletableMixin, SearchableMixin)** - DRY compliance across models
3. **TaskStatus enum** - Backend/frontend use enum references vs magic strings
4. **UUID utilities module** - Centralized app.core.uuid_utils
5. **Custom hooks (useFormSubmission, useResourceLoader, useAsyncAction)** - Eliminated state duplication
6. **MESSAGES constants** - Centralized error/success messages in lib/messages.ts
7. **BaseSelect component** - Unified select implementation with CVA variants, eliminated NoteForm inline duplication
8. **Project dict duplication** - duplication eliminated
9. **Home.tsx refactoring** - Reduced from 540 to 205 lines (62% reduction)
10. **Datetime standardization** - All code now uses `datetime.now(UTC)` (modern, timezone-aware)
11. **Environment configuration** - Centralized config module with VITE_API_BASE_URL support
12. **ProjectWithStats LSP violation** - Fixed by removing inheritance, using explicit fields with factory method
13. **alert() usage (17 occurrences)** - Toast system introduced
14. **Pydantic base schemas** - ResponseBase/SoftDeletableResponseBase inheritance eliminates ~20 lines of boilerplate across Task/Note/Project/Context schemas

### 🔄 Low Priority (Polish)
- Extract nested JSX from Inbox route (Home done - readability)
- Dependency injection with repository protocols (testability)
- Refactor Tailwind with cn() utility (maintainability)

## Critical Missing Features (Next Priorities)

### High Priority (Core GTD Workflow)
1. **Global keyboard shortcuts** - Only inbox processing has shortcuts (T/N/P/D)
   - Need: Cmd+K global trigger for UniversalCapture
   - Need: Navigation shortcuts (J/K, G+C for contexts, Space for complete)
2. **Context filtering** - Can assign contexts, can't filter by them
3. **Weekly review dashboard** - FR-1.18-20 not started

### Medium Priority (Polish Existing Features)
5. **Calendar view** - Date fields exist, no scheduling UI
6. **Project dashboard** - Can assign tasks, no project detail view
7. **Archive view** - Tasks archived but no dedicated view
8. **Saved filters** - Backend supports complex filtering, can't save combinations
9. **Bulk operations UI** - API ready, no multi-select UI

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)
10. **Dependency visualization** - DB field exists, no UI to show blocking chains
11. **Stalled project detection** - No "inactive >7 days" indicator
12. **Note auto-save** - Manual save only (spec says every 10s)
13. **Undo functionality** - NFR-1.08 not implemented
