## Code Quality Improvements

### ✅ Done
1. **BaseRepository pattern** - Eliminated ~70% duplication across 5 repositories
2. **Model Mixins (AuditMixin, SoftDeletableMixin)** - Consolidated timestamp fields across 4 models
3. **SearchableMixin** - Automatic field derivation for full-text search with proper inheritance
4. **Replace magic status strings with TaskStatus enum references** - Backend uses TaskStatus enum, frontend uses TaskStatusEnum constant object

### 🔄 To-Do (Quick Wins - Low Effort, High Impact)
- Deduplicate complete/uncomplete functions in task_controller
- Standardize datetime handling (use datetime.now(UTC) consistently)
- Extract shared UUID utilities to common module
- Create **useFormSubmit hook** - eliminate form state duplication in 4+ components
- Create **useDataFetch hook** - eliminate data loading pattern
- Create **BaseModal component** - standardize modal management
- Standardize error handling - replace alert() with toast/error boundary
- Extract message constants to messages.ts

### 🔄 To-Do (Medium Effort Improvements)
- Fix ProjectWithStats LSP violation (use composition instead of inheritance)
- Create Pydantic base schemas (ResponseBase, SoftDeletableResponseBase)
- Implement dependency injection with repository protocols
- Extract transformation logic to dedicated transformer classes
- Parameterize API base URL with environment variables
- Create **BaseSelect component** - unify StatusSelect, ProjectSelect, ContextSelect (80% duplicate code)
- Extract custom hooks from Home.tsx - useTaskManagement, useNoteManagement, useInboxManagement, useKeyboardShortcuts
- Create **useKeyboardShortcut hook** - eliminate duplication in Home.tsx and Inbox.tsx
- Refactor Tailwind patterns with cn() utility and variants

### 🔄 To-Do (Larger Refactors)
- Break down **537-line Home.tsx** - God Component violating SRP
- Create state management layer (service pattern or external store)
- Extract nested JSX components from Home and Inbox routes
- Add soft-delete for Context model (currently hard-deletes, inconsistent with other entities)

## Critical Missing Features (Next Priorities)

### High Priority (Core GTD Workflow)
1. **Global keyboard shortcuts** - Only inbox processing has shortcuts (T/N/P/D)
   - Need: Cmd+K global trigger for UniversalCapture
   - Need: Navigation shortcuts (J/K, G+C for contexts, Space for complete)
2. **Context filtering** - Can assign contexts, can't filter by them
3. **Weekly review dashboard** - FR-1.18-20 not started

### Medium Priority (Polish Existing Features)
5. **Calendar view** - Date fields exist, no scheduling UI
6. **Project dashboard** - Can assign tasks, no project detail view
7. **Archive view** - Tasks archived but no dedicated view
8. **Saved filters** - Backend supports complex filtering, can't save combinations
9. **Bulk operations UI** - API ready, no multi-select UI

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)
10. **Dependency visualization** - DB field exists, no UI to show blocking chains
11. **Stalled project detection** - No "inactive >7 days" indicator
12. **Note auto-save** - Manual save only (spec says every 10s)
13. **Undo functionality** - NFR-1.08 not implemented
