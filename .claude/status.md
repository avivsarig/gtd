## Critical Missing Features (Next Priorities)

### High Priority (Core GTD Workflow)
1. **Global keyboard shortcuts** - Only inbox processing has shortcuts (T/N/P/D)
   - Need: Cmd+K global trigger for UniversalCapture
   - Need: Navigation shortcuts (J/K, G+C for contexts, Space for complete)
2. **Search UI** - Backend FTS API working, no frontend search bar
3. **Context filtering** - Can assign contexts, can't filter by them
4. **Weekly review dashboard** - FR-1.18-20 not started

### Medium Priority (Polish Existing Features)
5. **Calendar view** - Date fields exist, no scheduling UI
6. **Project dashboard** - Can assign tasks, no project detail view
7. **Archive view** - Tasks archived but no dedicated view
8. **Saved filters** - Backend supports complex filtering, can't save combinations
9. **Bulk operations UI** - API ready, no multi-select UI

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)
10. **Dependency visualization** - DB field exists, no UI to show blocking chains
11. **Stalled project detection** - No "inactive >7 days" indicator
12. **Note auto-save** - Manual save only (spec says every 10s)
13. **Undo functionality** - NFR-1.08 not implemented
